After defeating a griffin for the local Nilfgaardian garrison, Geralt accompanies Yennefer to the city of Vizima, where they meet with Emperor Emhyr. Emhyr orders Geralt to find Ciri, who is Emhyr's biological, and Geralt's adopted daughter. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that grants her the power to manipulate time and space, and is being relentlessly stalked by the enigmatic Wild Hunt. Geralt learns of three places Ciri was recently seen: the war-ravaged swamp province of Velen, the free city-state of Novigrad, and the Skellige Isles.</p>

            <p class = "description" id="des_geralt">Geralt of Rivia is a famous witcher and the protagonist of the “Witcher” series. Geralt is also alternatively called the “White Wolf”, due to his pale skin and grey hair.

                Geralt spent most of his life at Kaer Morhen an old keep for training witchers, where he learned the art of slaying monsters, and had his body modified through mutagens, alchemy, and other means to achieve superhuman abilities.
                
                At the beginning of the first Witcher game, Geralt is discovered by his friends, having no recollection of his past life. As the story developers, he slowly recovers his memories.
                
                Unlike most video game characters, Geralt visibly ages through the three Witcher games, adding to the level of immersion. Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt follows Geralt on his final adventure.

            <p class = "description" id="des_yennefer">Although she has a prominent role in the Witcher books, in the games, Yennefer only makes an appearance in Witcher 3 and is only mentioned in passing in the first two games.

                Much like Triss, she is a powerful sorceress and was originally Geralt’s lover, before the Wild Hunt kidnapped her.
                
                Geralt supposedly lost his memory which chasing the Hunt to try and rescue her, before the events of the first Witcher game. Geralt finally reunites with Yennefer in Witcher 3.</p>

            <p class = "description" id = 'des_triss'>Triss Merigold is a young and beautiful sorceress who is one of Geralt’s main romance options in Witcher 3. She has followed Geralt throughout every Witcher game, although her storyline is somewhat different from the books, where Yennefer takes the role of Geralt’s main love interest.</p>

            <p class = "description" id = "des_vesemir">Vesemir is a veteran of the Witcher Wolf School – he is, in fact, the oldest living witcher alive, being the only one to survive the pogrom on Kaer Morhen long ago. He was also present in the original Witcher game, being one of the witchers that rescued Geralt after his amnesia.

                Vesemir is a wise and highly experienced warrior, acting as a father figure for the few remaining witchers in the world. Vesemir plays an important role in Witcher 3, providing guidance to Geralt.</p>

            <p class = "description" id = "des_ciri">Ciri is a young witcher-in-training and Geralt’s apprentice. Her destiny was intertwined with Geralt when he requested the “Law of Surprise” – an old custom, where a man who saves another can demand. It is a request for something which neither the savior nor the saved knows the nature of, until the saved man saved returns home.

                Typically this ends up being a child born while the father was away.
                
                At the time of Witcher 3, Ciri is being chased by the Wild Hunt – a mysterious group of wraiths who are the primary antagonists of the game. It is up to Geralt to find her before the Hunt. Ciri is also significant for being a playable character in Witcher 3.</p>
